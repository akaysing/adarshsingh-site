            <h2>Lucid Dream</h2>‚†Ä
            A novel by Atul Mohite
        </p> ‚†Ä
        <p>
            The book is a very short read,i was able to
            finish it in one sitting.Is the book that interesting and gripping well let's find out.‚†Ä

            The story is around a teenage boy who has just completed his high school exams and dreams
            of becoming a successful person.the author has tried his very best to make this character ‚Äúcool‚Äù
            but it doesn't work and the characters contempt for ‚Äútoppers‚Äù seems very bizarre considering he
            has two very academically achieving siblings and himself is a quite well to do in academics.For
            me this was very off-putting.Moving on from the central character we hardly get to know the
            other characters,there is absolutely no connection between the reader and the characters.
            I understand that sometimes a story is just a story there doesn't has to be something between
            the lines always but for that at least the story has to be good , this was a very lazy ,drab
            story.There was whole chapter dedicated to a orientation speech of a coaching institute,that
            was a very cheap attempt to get a few pages more in.I mean the synopsis does a better job to
            explain the title than the story.I think some relationships should have been explored more so
            that at least the reader could get some sort of emotional bond with characters and the world he
            is giving his time to. I mean i have read books that have made me lucid dream by some
            captivating characters,the book really disappoints in terms of character building.I recall in the
            book the two main characters have just one moment of some depth and that is it.Thankfully the
            novel is small and relieves you from agony sooner.
        </p>
        <p>The two star rating is just for the author‚Äôs immense heart and will to put out content in a cut
            throat industry.All the best to him for his future work.If you want to support him go ahead by the
            book. Please pardon the harshness and bad english(if i was good at it i would have written a
            book instead).</p>
