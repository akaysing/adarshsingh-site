            Chasing Wheels is a life-story of a dream chaser Rishi Sinha who overcomes his struggles to achieve his
            dream of buying a car. His pursuit of this dream helps him take on any challenges that life throws at
            him.Its a feel-good motivating story of a small town boy that fills the reader with joy and shows the
            importance of having dreams and working on them.â €

            The book does feel one-dimensional in the sense that it just races ahead never giving time to the characters
            to develop. It's a relatable story for the hard working youth of this country,the premise, the core of this
            story is so good but there is just no emotional connection established between the reader and the character.
            The book feels like reading a journal. A daily planner so to speak - wake up,make chai, go to college, go to
            work ,sleep, repeat. This continues throughout the book. I speed read the book and I did not miss any
            details. Many characters are reduced to passing remarks. The only time we get to know the character is in
            one phase where we get to know his thoughts which end up being the word â€˜dreamâ€™ being repeated too many
            times. The main love story also lacks an emotional connect and ends up like a filler. This whole book has
            all the ingredients for a great story but it just ends up like a collection of daily diary entries. Great
            theme but lack of an interesting plot and not a great way of story-telling lets down this book. Could have
            been edited a little more tighter and 100-150 pages short easily.â €
